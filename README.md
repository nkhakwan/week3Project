# Set up and instructions
* ## Mode 0
##### Input any number. And input 0 for the mode. If the number has 1, it'll be replaced by "BEEP!, for 2 "BOOP! and for 3 "Won't you be my neighbour. If the number has more than one combination of 1,2 and 3, it'll follow what comes first in 123 and would replace the string accordingly.
* ## Mode 1
##### Input number **ONLY** till 39. And select 1 in the mode. This is an extra work. It does the same as in mode 0 but if there is more than one combination of digits 1, 2 or 3, it sees what is the last digit from 1,2 or 3 and replaces the string accordingly. In mode 0, 12 would be replaced by "BEEP" but in mode 1, it'll be replaced by "BOOP".
